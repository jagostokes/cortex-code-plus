# Cortex Code Skills

Made by Jago Personal and Professional account for Zipline team. 

Skills to enhance [Snowflake's Cortex Code CLI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cortex-code/). Install skills to your local Cortex directory and invoke them in conversation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Copy all skills to your Cortex directory
cp -r skills/* ~/.snowflake/cortex/skills/

# Or add a single skill
cp -r skills/quality-check ~/.snowflake/cortex/skills/
```

In Cortex Code: `/skill list` to see available skills, or mention one by name: *"Run quality checks"*.
